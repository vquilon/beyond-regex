    <p>How often have you been bitten by a regex? 
Here's how the story usually goes.</p>
<p>Two months ago, you spent 20 minutes crafting a regex.
Today, you realize it has a bug and begin fixing it.
Except that it now reminds you more of hi&shy;ero&shy;glyph&shy;ics:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="sr">/?\w+((\s+\w+(\s*=\s*(?:&quot;&quot;.*?&quot;&quot;|&#39;.*?&#39;|[^&#39;&quot;&quot;&gt;\s]+))?)+\s*|\s*)/</span><span class="o">?&gt;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>And there aren't any unit tests, because you were nearing a deadline, and
writing <em>good</em> unit tests for regular ex&shy;pres&shy;sions is more tedious than
most unit tests.
Now you have to spend another 20 minutes figuring out what the regex does before
fixing it.
You finally fix it and push it to production, only to realize that there was a
case that used to work <span>&#8230;<a href="2013/a-true-regex-tester/index.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

    <p>Debuggex has launched a regex repository! Starting today, this is how you
can match an IPv4 address on <a href="../index.html">our site</a>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="p">(</span>?<span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">ipv4</span><span class="p">)</span>

<p>(The <code>(?&amp;</code> syntax is borrowed from PCRE's
<a href="http://www.autoitscript.com/autoit3/pcrepattern.html#SEC23">regex sub&shy;rou&shy;tines</a>.)</p>
<p>The concept is really simple - Debuggex has a list of pre-built ex&shy;pres&shy;sions
that you can use instead of wasting your time figuring them out by yourself.
We've already got a list of almost a hundred ex&shy;pres&shy;sions,
and we are constantly adding more.</p>
<p>There are a few key features that make our im&shy;ple&shy;men&shy;ta&shy;tion sig&shy;nif&shy;i&shy;cant&shy;ly
better than what you may have seen in other places.</p>
<h2>Unit Tests</h2>
<p>Debuggex was designed from the start with unit-testing and
backwards com&shy;pat&shy;i&shy;bil&shy;i&shy;ty in mind.

    </header>
    <p>I'm happy to announce that, starting on Saturday, Debuggex will have
support for PCRE regular ex&shy;pres&shy;sions!</p>
<p><strong>Everybody will have free access</strong> until August 1st
(tell your friends!). This will be
extended until August 15th for those that login with their Persona account.</p>
<p>While I'm putting on the finishing touches, here's a preview:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Look&shy;be&shy;hinds</strong>
    Debuggex shows you a backwards-facing sub-diagram to match your intuition
about how a <a href="http://www.autoitscript.com/autoit3/pcrepattern.html#lookbehind">lookbehind</a> works.</p>
<p><code>(?&lt;!fire)truck</code>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>More Flags</strong>
    PCRE supports <a href="http://www.autoitscript.com/autoit3/pcrepattern.html#SEC11">more flags</a> than JavaScript, and Debuggex now supports them as well.
On top of that, Debuggex makes your life
easier by showing you you exactly what your inline flags are acting upon.</p>

    <p>The
<a href="http://www.igg.me/at/debuggex"><s>crowd&shy;fund&shy;ing</s> market validation campaign</a>
for <a href="../index.html">Debuggex</a> (a visual regex tester) ended 4 days ago.
I had the very specific goal of getting
<a href="2013/ab-using-crowdfunding-to-validate-your-market/index.html">20 paying customers in 20 days</a>.
Un&shy;for&shy;tu&shy;nate&shy;ly, I didn't succeed. However, I did reach my funding goal of $960.
Debuggex received a total of $4374 in preorders, almost all of it from a single
customer.</p>
<p>To provide some context, the campaign launched 4 weeks ago and was heavily
aimed at single user sub&shy;scrip&shy;tions. There were basic ($48) and pro ($140) tiers
with varying levels of features, and a cheaper perk to get a Debuggex themed
poster ($25) for those that wanted  to support the product but weren't <span>&#8230;<a href="2013/how-my-crowdfunding-turned-into-singlefunding/index.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

<p>Debuggex is still a one-man team. Resources are very con&shy;strained, and time has to be properly managed. <strong>I want to focus on building a kick-ass platform for your regular ex&shy;pres&shy;sions</strong>. Mozilla is building a kick-ass identity provider/protocol, and using Persona costs me sub&shy;stan&shy;tial&shy;ly less effort than rolling out my own.</p>

<p>While most campaigns are built to raise enough funds to make a project possible, that's not the goal for Debuggex. Instead, <strong>the primary goal is to validate the market</strong>.</p>
<p>Debuggex is still in beta. However, for all but the simplest regular ex&shy;pres&shy;sions, users say it already provides a 3x decrease (against their previously preferred tool) in estimated total lifetime de&shy;vel&shy;op&shy;ment cost. For longer ex&shy;pres&shy;sions, users estimated even larger gains.</p>
<p>So value is already being created. But this is just the beginning. While Debuggex is a great tool <span>&#8230;<a href="2013/ab-using-crowdfunding-to-validate-your-market/index.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

        </h1>
    </header>
    <p>Two months ago, I launched a <a href="../index.html">regex tester</a>.</p>
<p>Why would I ever build a product around helping people with their regular ex&shy;pres&shy;sions? The market is tiny. There are dozens of free al&shy;ter&shy;na&shy;tives, and only a small percentage of people I've asked said they would pay for my product.</p>
<p>There are a few big advantages to be had competing in a smaller market.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>In a smaller market, everything happens on a smaller scale.</strong> Successes and failures are smaller in magnitude and take less time to pan out. Less effort is required to build a com&shy;pet&shy;i&shy;tive product, since the existing ones are not as well-developed. <span>&#8230;<a href="2013/why-the-hell-am-i-building-a-product-with-a-tiny-market/index.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p></li></ol>
