        </h1>

    <p>The
<a href="http://www.igg.me/at/debuggex"><s>crowd&shy;fund&shy;ing</s> market validation campaign</a>
for <a href="../../../index.html">Debuggex</a> (a visual regex tester) ended 4 days ago.
I had the very specific goal of getting
<a href="../ab-using-crowdfunding-to-validate-your-market/index.html">20 paying customers in 20 days</a>.
Un&shy;for&shy;tu&shy;nate&shy;ly, I didn't succeed. However, I did reach my funding goal of $960.
Debuggex received a total of $4374 in preorders, almost all of it from a single
customer.</p>
<p>To provide some context, the campaign launched 4 weeks ago and was heavily
aimed at single user sub&shy;scrip&shy;tions. There were basic ($48) and pro ($140) tiers
with varying levels of features, and a cheaper perk to get a Debuggex themed
poster ($25) for those that wanted  to support the product but weren't willing
to commit to a sub&shy;scrip&shy;tion.</p>
<p>In total, the campaign had 16 backers. Four backers purchased the $25 poster.
Six backers donated $5. That leaves only 6 legitimate customers, of which
nobody purchased the pro tier.</p>
<p><em>Aside: Debuggex needs paying users more than it needs paying nonusers. To
thank you for your continued support (and risk-taking spirit), all backers of
the poster and basic tier will be upgraded to the basic and pro tier,
re&shy;spec&shy;tive&shy;ly.</em></p>
<p><strong>91% of all revenue came from a single enterprise customer</strong>.
95% of all revenue was from customers intending to use Debuggex
in a work en&shy;vi&shy;ron&shy;ment.
That goes up to 98% if poster sales are excluded.</p>
<p>Despite the small sample size,
these numbers are a strong indication for where to aim my sales efforts.</p>
<p>Here are a few of the things I did wrong:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>20 days was too short of a period</strong>. Most people are used to 30-day funding
periods, and for them, seeing a project 25% funded with 14 days left is
dis&shy;heart&shy;en&shy;ing. 14 of the 16 backers con&shy;tributed before day 13 of 20.</p>
<p>In fact, prior to starting the campaign,
I should've asked potential customers to contribute on the first day in order
to exploit the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herd_mentality">public-vote-of-confidence effect</a>
for the full duration of the campaign.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>I sent personal emails to only 41 people</strong>.
I chose to notify those who had already showed sig&shy;nif&shy;i&shy;cant interest in
purchasing.  14 of them became backers, for a conversion rate of 34%.
In&shy;ci&shy;den&shy;tal&shy;ly, all 14 learned of the campaign only because of my email.</p>
<p>In hindsight, this was a big mistake. I should have gotten the word out even to
those that had not previously shown direct interest.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>I should've gotten more feedback on my video before launching the campaign</strong>.
If you can't pay attention to what I'm saying
because you are distracted by the quality of the video or audio,
then I've failed at com&shy;muncat&shy;ing.</p>
<p>Given how important it is for a startup to com&shy;mu&shy;ni&shy;cate with its users,
I've invested in equipment and software to make sure that never happens again.</p>
<p>Un&shy;for&shy;tu&shy;nate&shy;ly, I don't have any data about how effective the content
of the video was.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>During the campaign, there was a link from the Debuggex home page to the campaign page. <strong>The click-through rate of that link was
an abysmal 2%</strong>. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A/B_testing">A/B testing</a>
could have improved this sig&shy;nif&shy;i&shy;cant&shy;ly.</p>
<p><a href="../../../static/img/lowctr.png"><img alt="What the link looked like" src="../../../static/img/lowctr_small.png"/></a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Debuggex will continue to get better. Based on the outcome of this campaign,
there will be a lot more focus on the needs of corporate users. If you're part
of a company (or government) that uses regular ex&shy;pres&shy;sions in
mission-critical portions of your code or workflow,
I'd love to discuss how Debuggex can help solve your problems.</p>
<p>I will also keep exploring sus&shy;tain&shy;able ways of getting Debuggex into the
hands of single users.</p>
<p>If you'd like to give me <a href="mailto:debuggex@toarca.com">feedback</a> on
how to improve any aspect of my com&shy;mu&shy;ni&shy;ca&shy;tion, I'd love to hear it.
Compare <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i_phvq2nXU">attempt 0</a> and
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvUi1LxDZGc">attempt 1</a>
(re-edited but not refilmed).</p>
<p>p.s. There haven't been any public updates for a while, but I promise
that something awesome is in the pipeline, and will be released <em>very</em> soon.</p>
